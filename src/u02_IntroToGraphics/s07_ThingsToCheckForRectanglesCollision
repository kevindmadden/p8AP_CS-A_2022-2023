-Tips
 -I am asking you to reinvent the wheel here because
 it is a useful problem solving exercise.
    -It will help you see new possibilities for creative/complex things you could
    code that will be unique to you.
 -Reinventing the wheel is a good idea here, unless you want to offer
 suggestions on how to improve the efficiency to detect an arbitrarily shaped object
 in 3D instead.
 -Code to detect rectangle collisions is more complex than it is for circles.
 -Change one of the rectangles so that it follows your cursor's position.
 This will make it easier to check more thoroughly.
